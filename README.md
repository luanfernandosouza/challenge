# challenge

2.1 Factorial Hash

1. What approach are you going to use to solve the proposed problem?
Iterative solution or Recursive solution

2. What steps are you going to take to ensure that your solution and implementation are correct?
Identify the problem, provide solutions (if there is more than one), test and optimize the code.

3. How are you going to optimize (in terms of memory, speed or both) your implementation?
Through debuging analyzing the response time of the execution of each line of code.
